# ch9_listview

A new Flutter project.

The ListView.builder constructor takes an itemCount and uses the itemBuilder to build a widget
for each child record. 
Each child widget is added to the widget tree with the appropriate values. 

As each child widget is added, you can customize the ListView rows according to app specs.

Using the ListTile makes it extremely easy to align widgets. 

The ListTile takes a leading, trailing, title, subtitle, onTap, and other properties.
